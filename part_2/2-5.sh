# A project over at https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/scaling-exercise has a hardly working application. Go ahead and clone it for yourself. The project already includes docker-compose.yml so you can start it by running docker-compose up.
#
# Application should be accessible through http://localhost:3000. However it doesn’t work well enough and I’ve added a load balancer for scaling. Your task is to scale the compute containers so that the button in the application turns green.
