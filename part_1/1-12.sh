# 1.12: Hello, frontend!
#
# This exercise is mandatory
#
# A good developer creates well written READMEs that can be used to create Dockerfiles with ease.
#
# Clone, fork or download the project from https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend.
#
# Create a Dockerfile for the project (example-frontend) and give a command so that the project runs in a docker container with port 5000 exposed and published so when you start the container and navigate to http://localhost:5000 you will see message if you’re successful.
#
# Submit the Dockerfile.
#
# As in other exercises, do not alter the code of the project
#
# TIP: The project has install instructions in README.
#
# TIP: Note that the app starts to accept connections when “Accepting connections at http://localhost:5000” has been printed to the screen, this takes a few seconds
#
# TIP: You do not have to install anything new outside containers.
