# 1.4: Missing dependencies
# Start a ubuntu image with the process sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

# You will notice that a few things required for proper execution are missing. Be sure to remind yourself which flags to use so that the read actually waits for input.

# > Note also that curl is NOT installed in the container yet. You will have to install it from inside of the container.

# Test inputting helsinki.fi into the application. It should respond with something like

# ```
# <html>

# <head>
#   <title>301 Moved Permanently</title>
# </head>

# <body>
#   <h1>Moved Permanently</h1>
#   <p>The document has moved <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/">here</a>.</p>
# </body>

# </html>
# ```

# This time return the command you used to start process and the command(s) you used to fix the ensuing problems.

# > This exercise has multiple solutions, if the curl for helsinki.fi works then itâ€™s done. Can you figure out other (smart) solutions?

 # starts the container with a command that keeps it alive

 # intalls curl
