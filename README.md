# Docker Exercises

This is a learning group to deepen our understanding of Docker, based on [this beginner course](https://devopswithdocker.com/)
by the University of Helsinki.

The course includes both learning material and exercises.

## Getting started

- Install docker and docker-compose
- Fork this repository.
Each week you will open a merge request with your work, so can see everyone's progress and compare solutions.

## Structure

We will follow along the online course (see link above);
for each section (there are about 3 parts, each with around 6 sections), we will:

- read the section individually and work on the exercises
- meet up (or discuss asyncronously) to discuss the section, compare notes and exercises

Please find a living document of questions and comments ordered by exercise
[here (requires 8L email to access)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10DDMHfTIAL8Fg2dwJqfEplo0eNgaATDReGXt_qG9NaQ/edit#heading=h.anjzzih5xala)

## Time commitment

There is a total of around 18 sections across 3 course parts; each section should take (though this is a guess)
somewhere between 30 / 90 minutes to complete.

Doing one section per week and including a 30 minutes meeting with the group adds up to between an hour and two
a week for around 4 months. The meeting will be optional and we will have a running conversations on the Slack
group.

## Accountability

We will nominate a person each week who will:

- review the next section/exercises to work on
- communicate the above to the rest of the group
- setup/run the weekly meeting to discuss solutions to exercises/questions/ideas

Please check the calendar to see the Whale of the Week.
